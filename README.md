# Campingi Employee Reviews

This capstone project is dedicated to leveraging machine learning techniques to explore employee satisfaction at Capgemini. The primary goal is to gain valuable insights into the various factors influencing employee satisfaction within this organization. Through this analysis, the aim is to predict employee satisfaction ratings using a range of machine learning techniques, including sentiment analysis and classification algorithms.

The potential outcomes of this analysis hold considerable promise for Capgemini and similar organizations. By utilizing the predictive power of machine learning, this project could significantly enhance employee morale and overall satisfaction. Moreover, it could provide the company with the necessary knowledge to make data-driven decisions and implement targeted strategies to optimize the working environment and improve the overall employee experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkr1754/capgemini-employee-reviews-dataset).

### Data Elements

- **Title**: The job title or role of the employee providing the review.
- **Place**: The geographical location or city where the employee works.
- **Job_type**: The employment status of the reviewer (e.g., Full Time).
- **Department**: The specific department or functional area within the organization.
- **Date**: The date when the review was submitted.
- **Overall_rating**: A numerical rating given by the employee for their overall job satisfaction.
- **work_life_balance**: Rating indicating the work-life balance experienced by the employee.
- **skill_development**: Rating reflecting the opportunities for skill enhancement and growth.
- **salary_and_benefits**: Rating assessing the satisfaction with compensation and benefits.
- **job_security**: Rating expressing the employee's sense of job security.

## Analysis

Through this capstone project, the application of machine learning techniques has been instrumental in uncovering valuable insights into employee satisfaction at Capgemini. By leveraging various machine learning models, including sentiment analysis and classification algorithms, I have been able to predict employee satisfaction ratings effectively.

### Key Findings

1. **Significant Factors**: The analysis identified several key factors that significantly influence employee satisfaction, such as compensation, career growth opportunities, and work-life balance. These factors were consistently highlighted in the self-reported satisfaction data and supplementary datasets.

2. **Predictive Accuracy**: The predictive models developed during this project demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in forecasting employee satisfaction levels. The models were trained on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which included self-reported employee satisfaction data, and were further enhanced by integrating additional relevant data such as salary structures and demographics. In general, the models achieved an accuracy of up to 65%. This relatively moderate accuracy might be due to the "Overall_rating" column having five possible values, making it a multi-class classification problem rather than a binary classification.

3. **Impact on Employee Morale**: The insights gained from this analysis have the potential to substantially improve employee morale and overall satisfaction within Capgemini. By understanding the specific elements that contribute to satisfaction, the company can implement targeted strategies to address areas of concern and foster a more positive work environment.

4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: The use of machine learning has equipped Capgemini with the ability to make informed, data-driven decisions. This approach enables the company to implement precise interventions aimed at optimizing the working conditions and enhancing the overall employee experience.

### Recommendations

1. **Competitive Compensation**: Review and adjust compensation packages to ensure they are competitive and fair, addressing one of the primary concerns highlighted by employees.

2. **Career Development**: Invest in career development programs and opportunities for growth, which were shown to be significant contributors to employee happiness.

By the end of this project, not only have we developed a robust predictive model for employee satisfaction, but we have also gathered a wealth of knowledge that can empower Capgemini and similar organizations to create a more positive and productive work environment for their employees.
